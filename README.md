# hackerrank-js

These are all the problems I solved in HackerRank by far, using JavaScript (Node.js). 

I'm trying to use ES6 new features whenever possible.

Don't forget to install Jest before running the tests.
```
npm test // run all tests
npm test specific.test // run tests matching pattern
```
